6.Sentiment Analysis Using Python | Introduction & Techniques

A sentiment analysis determines negative, positive, or neutral emotions within the text  using NLP and ML models. Sentiment analysis or opinion mining refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. 
 Data set used in particular for Twitter sentiment Analysis 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XTSQKOcf4NqCtfduk20V5O8yxlozsnDX/view?usp=sharing
we aim to analyze Twitter sentiment analysis Dataset using machine learning algorithms, the sentiment of tweets provided from the Sentiment140 dataset by developing a machine learning pipeline involving the use of three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and SVM)along with using Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The performance of these classifiers is then evaluated using accuracy and F1 Scores.
For data preprocessing, we will be using Natural Language Processing’s (NLP) NLTK library.
Problem Statement
In this project, we try to implement an NLP Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of sentiment classification of tweets. We will be classifying the tweets into positive or negative sentiments.
The dataset provided is the Sentiment140 Dataset which consists of 1,600,000 tweets that have been extracted using the Twitter API. The various columns present in this Twitter data are:
•	target: the polarity of the tweet (positive or negative)
•	ids: Unique id of the tweet
•	date: the date of the tweet
•	flag: It refers to the query. If no such query exists, then it is NO QUERY.
•	user: It refers to the name of the user that tweeted
•	text: It refers to the text of the tweet

The various steps involved in the Machine Learning Pipeline are:
•	Import Necessary Dependencies
•	Read and Load the Dataset
•	Exploratory Data Analysis
•	Data Visualization of Target Variables
•	Data Preprocessing
•	Splitting our data into Train and Test sets.
•	Model Testing/ Training 
•	Model Evaluation



Key Takeaways
•	Twitter Sentimental Analysis is used to identify as well as classify the sentiments that are expressed in the text source.
•	Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes are some of the ML algorithms that can be used for Twitter Sentimental Analysis Python.

n this project, we successfully tackled the problem of hate speech detection in tweets by classifying them as either racist/sexist or non-racist/non-sexist. Using a dataset of 31,962 tweets, we implemented a robust preprocessing pipeline that included removing Twitter handles, special characters, and short words, followed by tokenization and stemming.
Through exploratory data analysis, we gained valuable insights into the frequency of words and hashtags associated with both categories of tweets, which guided our understanding of language patterns indicative of hate speech.
For model training, we utilized a Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation of the text data and employed a Logistic Regression classifier. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 94.3% and an F1 score of 0.55 when adjusting the classification threshold. These results indicate that while the model performs well in distinguishing between racist/sexist and non-racist/non-sexist tweets, there is room for improvement in the balance between precision and recall.
Future work could explore advanced techniques such as deep learning models or ensemble methods to enhance classification performance further. Additionally, expanding the dataset to include a more diverse range of hate speech could improve the model's robustness and generalizability. Overall, this project underscores the importance of employing computational methods to address hate speech in online platforms, contributing to efforts aimed at fostering safer and more inclusive digital spaces.
